WebComparator is a browser-based database front-end for managing
comparative linguistic data. Right now, it uses SQLite, though it will
eventually be usable with other database engines as well. The database
interface and business logic are written in Haskell. The interface is
written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS (with JQuery, JQuery UI, and JQGrid).
